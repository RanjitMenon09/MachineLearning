      "Let us see the data in a day.\n",
      "There are a lot of data\n",
      "that is generated in a day,\n",
      "so there are around 500 millions of reads,\n",
      "300 millions of text data,\n",
      "400 gigabytes of video data and so on.\n",
      "So all of which which is relevant\n",

      "Let's see. What is data in LP?\n",

      "Data that stores language data quality data.\n",

      "There are a lot of columns.\n",
      "There are a lot of words in\n",

      "When compared with the previous slide,\n",
      "which is the banking data,\n",
      "what differences did you see?\n",

      "There is no specific format.\n",
      "You have just some heading\n",

      "you have a data that is not organized.\n",

      "Yes here also.\n",
      "Even though you don't see\n",
      "any kind of organization,\n",
      "but you can have like this,\n",

      "This is also unstructured data.\n",
      "So. So we have two categories.\n",

      "structured data fixed dimension,\n",
      "just as the banking data set that we saw,\n",
      "everything is organized usually in\n",
      "tables or in a key value pair like Jason.\n",
      "Object JSON representation and so on.\n",
      "And it is simple to process because we\n",

      "Frozen columns that are there\n",
      "in the daytime so.\n",
      "It is processed directly and there is no\n",
      "need for intermediate representations.\n",
      "Brothers in unstructured data.\n",
      "There is no specific dimension,\n",
      "so it's very hard and it is\n",
      "not organized\n",
