      "These go up very easily and I love the cordless feature. Color is perfect too.\n",
      "When using the rod to open the blind, the rod gets stuck and snaps back to the original position. It requires frequent adjustments but ultimately works.\n",
      "one of the top brackets was broken.  how do I get a replacement?\n",
      "I love the sting free pushing and pulling to adjust the blind height. No tangles. Very hands free. Nothing getting stuck. And fast!\n",
      "Very agitating to order a 25 x 72 inch blind (a replacement) and it comes in the box that says 25x72 but it's actually measuring at 24.5 x 72 and that little bit throws it all off.  Contacted walmart and they contacted seller but never heard anything from seller so got a refund.  Just agitating .\n",
      "I was so happy to be able to order these blinds for my narrow windows with out special ordering. The first set went up well but the 2nd set drooped. I tried to re-adjust the placement of the bracket to see if that would help and the bottom support of the bracket snapped off. Now I have no privacy between my front window and the street.\n",
      "The blind was suppose to have been with 2\" Slat.  The item was a 1\" mini-blind.  There was no size of slat on the description on line or on the product.  I have returned and hoping to receive full credit.  Returned last week and have not received any confirmation.\n",

      "MY WIFE SAYS THERE ADORABLE. FOR VALUE AND QUALITY WAL-MART HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY GO TO STORE.\n",
      "The only reason I put 4 out of 5 stars was because the color they show in picture 1 looks like a Vibrant orange like a Halloween vibe. Well scroll to picture 4 And thats the actual color It is more like a burnt orange give me like a Thanksgiving vibe. However the sheets are super soft not a weird silky soft like a quilt type soft and they fit over my 18 inch thick king size mattress no problem. I did not need to stretch to fit that last corner of the mattress the sheets went on no problem and got very nicely. I would definitely try again and hope the color shown 6 out of 7 pictures is the color Im  getting! Other than that I purchased a very good quality set of sheets for a really good price\n",
      "I thought i would like this pink color but its not for me i should've went for a different color other than that they're soft which is a definite plus i have such sensitive skin so anything slightly scratchy is a no go. This was better than expected like i said soft I'll definitely be buying another but different color for my King size bed if it wasn't for the color i would've gave it 5 stars also love the stripe details on the pillow cases surprised it's not on the sheet also\n",
      "Color is hot pink, not what I had in mind. But is workable with my shabby chic\n",
      "Will not stay on mattress as the elastic is extremely small and poor quality. Stitching has already come  unsown on the pillow case.\n",
      "The sheets are not orange like in the picture. They are an ugly salmon color.\n",
      "Sheets arrived and were really dirty. Looks like it may have been used\n",
      "This is really to smalle and I don't think this is the correct size that I ordered\n",
      "color is perfect. its soft\n",
      "We've been shopping for Bed-Tite deep fitting sheet sets. Once these were applied to the beds, colors became the differences. They fit perfectly. The colors were as described. Several sizes were ordered and fit the size mattress that was purchased for. Highly recommend.\n",
      "Light is being used above the stairway to the basement. Lights the stairs well and can also accent the artwork. It is the perfect light the installation - well worth the money. With 5 lights, there are many wires that need to be dealt with. Overall not too difficult.\n",
      "The sheets are soft and comfortable, but they also seem cheaply made.....there are already snags after one washing (and no sleeping!). Also - the color is orange. I know orange is a bright color, but holy mackerel - the brightness almost shines through my closed eyes! I was hoping for something a bit more \"peachy\" than neon.  I can't help but compare these sheets to the last set of sheets I bought from a different manufacturer. The earlier purchased sheets are soft and comfortable, but they are also very well made, and sturdy. They've been washed multiple times, and still feel like new. I don't feel confident about these new, orange sheets holding up as well.\n",
      "This replaced a single flood light over a bar in my kitchen. I had to buy a separate adapter kit that allow the wiring to 'screw' into my existing fixture. Tricky to get device attached - you need three hands or a helper....but job was straight forward. Instructions clear. I wanted more light than given by the 100W flood I was replacing. I realize now that 30W would have been sufficient rather than the 50W bulbs I ordered. The ability to point the individual lights also let me light up a telephone near the bar.\n",
      "Awful quality. As I was putting them on the mattress for the first time they ripped. They will be going back.\n",
      "We installed this light to replace an old flourescent fixture in our medium-sized kitchen. It provides great lighting and really makes the granite countertops stand out. My husband installed it without much difficulty, the only time consuming part of the installation was getting the light bulbs in place (the included suction cup holder was a big help with tightening the bulbs into place).\n",
      "Ordered these sheets because I ripped a hole in my favorite set of sheets, and the only set of deep pocket sheets I had only to get it in the mail, put it on the bed and notice there was a hole in the middle of the fitted sheet. Called to get a replacement and haven't heard anything back. Do not buy.\n",
      "Installed in my 17x15 kitchen as main source of lighting. Lights the room, although could benefit from 1-2 recessed lights.\n",
      "Don't understand why reviews are always asked for, before you even have time to use the product! That said, I have not used this item! I gave 3 stars, inhopes the quality will be decent and that they will fit. Disappointed that the color I received is not the color depicted. They are a nice enough color, just not what I wanted! Will be keeping, and keeping fingers crossed, because reviews were decent and maybe once I wash them, they won't fall apart before the next use...\n",
      "Installed light in my kitchen and my wife loves it. Not difficult to install however a second pair of hands to hold the light while one person connects the wires is best. I would definitely recommend putting the shades and bulbs in before you hang it as they are a little difficult to put on. The light is bright, however each light only lights up a small area as they are more like spot lights.The light I replaced was a three light ceiling fan with three 60 watt bulbs and they more evenly lit up my kitchen. That being said,I would still buy again.\n",

      "Used two in my kitchen as a primary light source -looks great and gives good lighting. I also have on a dimmer to achieve ambient lighting. Love the look!\n",
      "I purchased the burgundy red hoping to keep my gold and burgundy colors in my room. When it arrived I was horrified. It was the ugliest burnt orange color that I have ever seen. Wal-Mart told me no returns during this pandemic. so I'm stuck using this gross color in my burgundy and gold room. I usually have really good experiences ordering so this is a first for me.\n",
      "Went up easily on the wall. Glass shades are very attractive. Lighting looks better with frosted bulbs, but the included ones were spot lights. It is a little tricky to get bulbs into fixture, but hopefully won't have to do that too often.\n",
      "color in pictures shows a darker yellow.\n",
      "We put 2 of these in our kitchen and they look great. You can point each lamp in any direction for custom lighting. One of the face plates was a little off with the hole placements but my husband was able to grind them to fit.\n",
      "These are great sheets, especially for the price.  When we first opened the package I thought they were cheaply made since they were so light.  I was pleasantly surprised at how light and soft they are while being very well made.  They have held up well in the washer and dryer.  The best part for me is that they truly have deep pockets and fit our 16 inch mattress very easily.\n",
      "The light is beautiful, easy to assemble and install. The shades and bulbs required nimble fingers to install, but neither are a major problem. Good product.\n",
      "Not made very well. Way smaller than I thought it would be. Not very bright at all, I will have to install pot lights with this light. Honestly the only thing I like about this light is the looks of it. I got the black with blood red shade.\n",
      "Looks better than in the picture. Cool design and provides bright light.\n",
      "Attaching rings, glass and bulb a little tricky, but doable.\n",
      "very pretty and very bright i have an old house and needed an electrician to install it took him a while to do it too\n",
      "Needed overhead light. This is perfect. Had an electrician install as he was doing other work in my home.\n",
      "I am pleased with the look of the light but it is not as sturdy as I would have expected for what I paid.\n",
      "love the contemporary design. Hate that I put it together by the picture on the box.\n",
      "This fixture looks great and is excellent value.\n",
      "I have the 5-light fixture in my kitchen and the 3-light fixture in my hallway. They provide wonderful (adjustable) light and look great for their respecitve prices. HOWEVER, changing the bulbs is difficult as there is not enough room b/t bulb & shade to grasp bulb and twist. I found that wrapping a thin cloth around the spent bulb and using kitchen tongs to grasp & twist counter-clockwise was most successful.\n",
      "Really pretty and good shade\n",
      "Very pleased with umbrella. Perfect size for our small patio. Just put it up so too soon to know how it will last.\n",

      "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Easy to operate, well made and handsome. The only reason I gave only 4 stars is that based on product photos...I thought this umbrella came with a base.\n",
      "This umbrella appears to be well made and has a sunbrella material shade. But this is not a 7.5 ft umbrella. It only measures 6'10\" when opened.

Fills the bill nicely!\n",
      "Perfect Unbrella for our deck. Arrived very quickly.\n",
      "We spent weeks trying to find white umbrellas with white poles, but found them either very expensive or flimsy! We like white as they are easy to bleach if stains appear and still look like new! Colored ones often fade or change color! These umbrellas were PERFECT! Such sturdy and well designed items were impossible to find in our area! They are ready right out of the box and have had no issues turning recent windy spring days!!! Wonderful product... We couldn't be happier!!\n",
      "I have three 11foot umbrellas in a row across my back yard. The umbrellas are beautiful and very high....I needed the height so I could bury them in the ground instead of using a stand that blows over. Blue Red Blue - 11 feet times 3 - it really is beautiful! The double vents should help with any breezes and the sunbrella fabric will keep them looking good.\n",
      "It is a beautiful umbrella which arrived very quickly and without any issues. It is replacing a 21 year old 11 ft market umbrella with a wooden pole and sunbrella cover which was finally starting to show wear on the cover fabric. If this new one lasts as long as the old one did, that will be great. I really like the wind feature with 3 sections of fabric. It handles the Las Vegas winds nicely. I ordered a cover from CoverMates so it should last a long time.\n",
      "Umbrella was delivered ahead of schedule and was well packaged and arrived in great shape. Umbrella was exactly as described and the quality of construction is excellent.\n",
      "Pulley system...opened the umbrella before placing it in the stand to test it.. FYI... this is a two person job as I almost crushed two fingers pushing in the lock button. Ended up with 2 chunks of shin from my fingers gone. I could not get it too open for some reason as easily previously I had. Searched web thinking I did something wrong. No results online showing how to open. Finally got the neighbor next door to help and got it open. Nice product but again 2 oeople\n",
      "Material is nicer than I thought it would be, thicker. I like how the breeze goes through because it's often windy here on the river. I gave it a 4 because it has a tiny tear near the very top of the umbrella - almost like it was stretched too far and tore.\n",
      "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Overall a very nice umbrella. Pluses are good quality manufacturing, nice design and provides good shade. Minuses, cord hangs free with no double hook to wind it around, small areas where the pattern of the fabric are missing resulting in white colorless strips that look like tears but actually have fabric there, it just missing the color pattern of the rest of the fabric.\n",
      "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Love these! Very sturdy and chic. We looked everywhere for umbrellas with white poles. These are beautiful. Look like hotel quality. The white olefin looks like it will hold up well and be easy to clean.\n",
      "This is the second California umbrella we have purchased. We are pleased with the quality of the product.\n",
      "Being in the service industry, it is always a pleasure to encounter someone who truly understands what the term means. I would recommend Hayneedle to anyone that is looking for a great product and great SERVICE.\n",
      "Have not had very long, but was very happy to find a white pole at a fair price. When we had it up it was sturdy and easy to tilt. We do cover and take in on very windy days so hope this will last awhile.\n",
      "Outstanding, I love this umbrella! It's beautiful and made of quality material, It's perfect for.our back yard table where we enjoy a gorgeous view. I have shopped around and will only purchase this quality product from Hayneedle.\n",

      "The description says the sheet fits up to an 18 inch mattress. My mattress is 18 inches. It does go on and stay put, for the most part, bit it does slide up the side of the mattress occasionally. Its possible thats due to my vinyl mattress protector being a little slick. The only thing that bugs me and isnt even really a problem is the elastic band doesn't be go completely under the mattress all the way around. It tucks on the corners but not the middle portions of each side. It could be my ocd or the fact that the sheet isn't deep enough. The sheet set is super comfy and my boyfriend, who doesn't even like a top sheet, now sleeps under this one because it feels great.\n",

I ordered king size and have 4 standard pillows rather than 2 king size.  I supplement with 2 contrasting pillowcases.

I would have given it a 5 star rating if the letter was attached to the mat.  Its a round disk that can lift out of the center and moves around a big.

I can always count on them to send the very best, and in a timely fashion. This chest is a good size, but is relatively light weight at only 41 pounds and comes fully assembled. Kids love the design, because it resembles a Pirate's chest and it is easily painted. The center safety hinge and front opening make it safe for children. I would definitely recommend this product to buyers above all others that I have seen on the market, and the reasonable price seals the deal!\n",

[...] The chest is of high quality and will do well with young children. Great value, high quality, easy purchase and delivery!\n",
      "I was pleasently surprised by the quality and construction of this toy box, it looks beautifuly hand crafted. Purchased for my first grandchild ,so I could store toys at my home, when she comes and visits her grandma. I really like the safetly features. Fantastic product!!\n",
      "I wanted a toy box for my our Granddaughter to use at our house. This Captain's chest fit the bill perfectly. Her safety was the number one consideration. This chest has the safety hinge and the cut out area to keep her finger from getting mashed. The price was great. The size was perfect for where we wanted to place it. We opted for the unfinished so we could match the furniture color in the family room. We will be able to use this for storage long after the grandchildren will not longer need it. Made from solid pine, we know it durability.\n",
      "Great product for toys or clothes that are over flowing. Finally something built to last like the old fashion days. Comes pre assembled and ready to use no inconvenience and time wasting effort to build. Design it the way to want get it unfinished be creative. Great price point and very affordable for what you get.\n",
      "On my 7th chest, and as always, great quality. Looks like a piece of furniture. Beautiful wood, and well constructed\n",
      "Very pleased , Just as described with no surprizes . Packed extra well with plenty padding . No chance of being damaged under normal conditions . Wood fitted properly with no cracks . Would recommend the company to everyone !\n"
